## Overview

DotNet Bookstore is an ASP.NET Core MVC CRUD application that manages a bookstore's catalogue of books and categories. It uses Entity Framework Core with SQL Server (Azure) for data persistence, ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication, and a fully custom Bootstrap 5 design system for a modern, responsive UI.

The project demonstrates real-world patterns including:

- One-to-many relational data (Category → Books)
- EF Core eager loading with `.Include()`
- Scaffolded CRUD controllers with post-scaffolding fixes
- ASP.NET Core Identity (registration, login, logout)
- Bootstrap 5 responsive layout with Bootstrap Icons
- CSS custom properties for a consistent design token system
- Reactive UI elements (live cover image preview via FileReader API, empty states, hover effects)
- **File upload** — cover images uploaded via `multipart/form-data`, saved to `wwwroot/img/books/` with GUID-prefixed filenames; old files deleted on replace or book removal

## Educational Comments

> **Students and learners — please read this section before diving into the code.**

Every source file in this repository has been annotated with two layers of purposeful, curriculum-aligned comments. They are not boilerplate — they are a structured learning resource written specifically for this course. Treat them as an integrated textbook that lives right next to the code it explains.

### What was added and why

| Layer | Where you find it | What it teaches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **File header block** | Top of every `.cs`, `.cshtml`, `.css`, and `.js` file | States the file's purpose in plain English and lists the specific ASP.NET Core / C# concepts demonstrated inside |
| **Inline comments** | Alongside individual lines, blocks, and decisions throughout each file | Explains *why* the code is written the way it is — the reasoning, the trade-offs, and the common mistakes it avoids |

### Commented files and their key concepts

| File | Key concepts covered in the comments |
|---|---|
| `Program.cs` | `WebApplicationBuilder`, Dependency Injection, EF Core registration, Identity setup, middleware pipeline order, convention-based routing |
| `Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs` | `DbContext` vs `IdentityDbContext`, `DbSet<T>` as a table, constructor injection of `DbContextOptions`, migrations workflow, optional Fluent API |
| `Models/Category.cs` | POCO model, primary key by convention, `[Required]` / `[DisplayName]` data annotations, navigation properties |
| `Models/Book.cs` | Foreign key property, navigation property, `[ValidateNever]`, `null!` null-forgiving operator, `[Range]`, `[DisplayFormat]` |
| `Models/CartItem.cs` | Database-persisted cart pattern, price snapshot, `CustomerId` as identity key, FK + navigation property pair |
| `Models/Order.cs` | Order header / detail split pattern, `decimal` for currency, capturing shipping data at checkout time |
| `Models/OrderDetail.cs` | Junction/bridge table concept, two FKs in one model, price capture, `[ValidateNever]` on navigation properties |
| `Models/ErrorViewModel.cs` | ViewModel vs. entity, expression-bodied property (`=>`), nullable reference types |
| `Controllers/HomeController.cs` | MVC controller anatomy, action methods, `IActionResult`, `return View()`, `[ResponseCache]` |
| `Controllers/CategoriesController.cs` | Full CRUD HTTP mapping, `async`/`await`, `[HttpPost]`, `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]`, `[Bind]`, `ModelState.IsValid`, `DbUpdateConcurrencyException`, PRG pattern |
| `Controllers/BooksController.cs` | All of the above **plus**: eager loading with `.Include()`, `SelectList` + `ViewBag`, repopulating dropdowns on validation failure, the 10 numbered post-scaffolding fixes; `IFormFile` file upload, `IWebHostEnvironment.WebRootPath`, GUID filename strategy, `UploadImage()` / `DeleteImage()` helpers, preserving existing image on edit, deleting orphaned files on delete |
| `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` | Master layout template, `@RenderBody()`, `@RenderSectionAsync`, TempData flash messages, active nav link detection, `asp-append-version` cache busting |
| `Views/Shared/_LoginPartial.cshtml` | Partial views, `@inject` in Razor, `SignInManager`, logout as a POST request (CSRF prevention) |
| `Views/Shared/_ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml` | Client-side vs. server-side validation, jQuery Validate, unobtrusive validation bridge |
| `Views/Shared/Error.cshtml` | `@model` directive, ViewModel in a view, production vs. development error pages |
| `Views/_ViewImports.cshtml` | Global `@using` namespaces, `@addTagHelper`, Tag Helper overview |
| `Views/_ViewStart.cshtml` | `_ViewStart` implicit hook, setting the default layout, per-view overrides |
| `Views/Home/Index.cshtml` | Razor code blocks, `@*...*@` server-side comments, `asp-controller`/`asp-action`, Bootstrap grid, responsive utilities |
| `Views/Books/Index.cshtml` | Strongly-typed `@model`, `.ToList()` to avoid double-enumeration, `@foreach`, conditional rendering, `asp-route-id`, empty state UX |
| `Views/Books/Create.cshtml` | `asp-action` on `<form>`, `enctype="multipart/form-data"` for file upload, `<input type="file">` with `accept`, `asp-for` on labels and text inputs, `asp-validation-for`, `asp-items` + `ViewBag` dropdown, FileReader API live preview IIFE, `@section Scripts` |
| `Views/Books/Edit.cshtml` | Hidden `BookId` field, `enctype="multipart/form-data"`, existing cover thumbnail with `~/img/books/` path, file input to replace image, "leave empty to keep" hint, FileReader live preview for new selection, pre-populated inputs, category pre-selection |
| `Views/Books/Details.cshtml` | Read-only view, `@Html.DisplayFor`, `<dl>` definition list, null-conditional `?.`, two-column Bootstrap layout |
| `Views/Books/Delete.cshtml` | Two-step GET→POST delete, hidden PK field, danger styling conventions, Cancel as a safe link |
| `Views/Categories/*.cshtml` | All of the above patterns applied to a simpler, one-field entity — ideal for seeing the concepts in their most direct form |
| `wwwroot/css/site.css` | CSS custom properties (design tokens), Bootstrap override strategy, transitions, responsive `@media` queries, `object-fit: cover`, accessibility focus rings |
| `wwwroot/js/site.js` | `wwwroot` as the web root, script load order, `DOMContentLoaded`, separation of concerns, commented auto-dismiss example |

### How to get the most out of the comments

1. **Read the header block first.** Before studying any method or template, read the `KEY CONCEPTS` list at the top of the file. It tells you exactly what to watch for.
2. **Trace a full request.** Pick one action — for example, creating a book — and follow it from `BooksController.Create (GET)` → `Views/Books/Create.cshtml` → `BooksController.Create (POST)`. Read every inline comment along that path.
3. **Compare Create and Edit.** The `Create` and `Edit` views are nearly identical. The inline comments highlight the exact lines that differ and explain *why* (hidden PK field, pre-selected dropdown, image pre-load). This comparison is a fast way to understand model binding.
4. **Read the controller before the view.** The controller comment explains what data it prepares (`ViewBag`, `SelectList`, `.Include()`). Once you understand what arrives at the view, the view's markup makes much more sense.
5. **Don't skip the CSS.** `site.css` comments explain every design decision — from CSS custom properties to the book cover `object-fit` trick. If you plan to customise the UI, read Section 1 (Design Tokens) first.
6. **Ask "why", not just "what".** Most inline comments are written to answer *why* the code is written a particular way — a security reason (`[Bind]`, `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]`), a convention (`null!`, `string.Empty`), or a fix to a scaffolding gap (`.Include()`, `SelectList`). Look for those explanations.

## Features

### Books Management

- **List** all books in a **responsive card grid** (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 columns) with cover art, category badge, Mature Content badge, author, title, and price
- **Create** a new book with author, title, cover image file upload (PNG/JPEG; live FileReader preview), price, mature content toggle, and category dropdown
- **Edit** an existing book — existing cover thumbnail shown; upload a new file to replace it (leave empty to keep current); category dropdown pre-selects the current value
- **View Details** — two-column card layout with full-height cover image on the left and metadata on the right
- **Delete** — danger-themed confirmation card with a cover thumbnail and full book summary; the associated image file is removed from disk on confirmation

### Categories Management

- **List** all categories in a **responsive card grid** (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 columns) with icon, name, and action buttons
- **Create**, **Edit**, **View Details**, and **Delete** categories with consistent card-wrapped forms and danger confirmation flow

### Authentication
- User registration and login via ASP.NET Core Identity
- Email confirmation required (`RequireConfirmedAccount = true`)
- Navbar displays logged-in username with manage and logout links

### UX Enhancements

- **Active nav link** highlighting — current controller auto-detected at render time
- **TempData toast area** in the layout — controllers can set `TempData["SuccessMessage"]` or `TempData["ErrorMessage"]` for dismissible Bootstrap alerts
- **Empty states** on index pages — icon, message, and CTA when no records exist
- **Live cover preview (FileReader API)** — on Create, when a file is selected in the picker the FileReader API reads the bytes locally and shows a preview before the form is submitted; on Edit, the existing cover thumbnail is shown server-side and a new preview appears only when a replacement file is chosen
- **Graceful image fallback** — gradient placeholder with a book icon is always rendered behind cover images; shows through on `onerror` with no JS required

---

## UI/UX Design

All views share a unified design language built on **Bootstrap 5** and a custom CSS design token system in `site.css`. Bootstrap Icons 1.11.3 is loaded via CDN.

### Design Tokens (`site.css`)

A set of CSS custom properties drives the entire visual theme:

```css
--brand-gradient        /* deep indigo → purple → indigo (navbar, footer) */
--hero-gradient         /* darker 3-stop indigo gradient (home hero) */
--brand-gradient-light  /* soft indigo→lavender (card covers, placeholders) */
--card-shadow           /* subtle multi-layer shadow */
--card-shadow-hover     /* lifted indigo-tinted shadow on hover */
--radius-card           /* .75rem — all cards and alerts */
--radius-btn            /* .5rem — all buttons and inputs */
--transition            /* 220ms ease — card and button transitions */
```

### Global Layout (`_Layout.cshtml`)

- **Navbar** — deep indigo gradient (`--brand-gradient`), amber brand badge icon, active link highlighted in gold, smooth background-fade on hover. Active state is detected server-side via `ViewContext.RouteData.Values["controller"]`.
- **Footer** — matching indigo gradient, responsive three-column layout (brand name / copyright / Privacy + GitHub links).
- **TempData alerts** — success and error banners rendered automatically between the navbar and main content area; dismissible via Bootstrap's `btn-close`.
- `min-vh-100` flex-column body keeps the footer pinned at the bottom on short pages.

### Home Page (`Home/Index.cshtml`)

- **Hero section** — full-width indigo/purple gradient card with an SVG dot-pattern texture overlay, large display heading with amber accent, lead text, and two CTA buttons (Browse Books / Categories).
- **Feature cards** — three equal-height cards (Books, Categories, Account) with lift-on-hover effect, coloured icon badges, and action buttons.
- **Tech strip** — a secondary info band showing Identity, EF Core, and Bootstrap with icons.

### Books Views

| View | Design |
|---|---|
| `Index` | Responsive card grid; cover art with gradient-placeholder fallback behind image; category + Mature badges; price in green; icon action buttons in card footer |
| `Create` / `Edit` | Centred card form; `input-group` with Bootstrap Icons; small uppercase muted labels; `type="file"` cover image picker with FileReader live preview; Edit shows existing cover thumbnail; Mature Content toggle in a highlighted box; `divider-gradient` separator before action buttons |
| `Details` | Two-column card — full-height cover (or gradient placeholder) on left, metadata on right; category and rating badges; price in large green text |
| `Delete` | Red-bordered card with cover thumbnail, two-column summary; danger alert banner with triangle icon; "Delete Permanently" button |

### Categories Views

| View | Design |
|---|---|
| `Index` | Responsive card grid; tag icon in a rounded success-tinted badge; lift-on-hover; icon action buttons in card footer |
| `Create` / `Edit` | Centred card form; tag icon `input-group`; `autofocus` on Create; divider before buttons |
| `Details` | Gradient header band (indigo-subtle) with tag icon + category name; Edit / Delete / Back buttons |
| `Delete` | Danger header band + danger alert warning about book assignments; "Delete Permanently" button |

### Shared Components

- **Error page** — large danger octagon icon, `alert-secondary` for Request ID, yellow-tinted card for dev-mode info
- **Privacy page** — centred card with shield icon and divider
- **Empty states** — faint indigo icon, muted heading, small descriptor text, and a CTA button; used on both Books and Categories index pages

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
- [Visual Studio 2026](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (or VS Code with C# Dev Kit)
- SQL Server (local instance or Azure SQL Database)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dario-Hesami/DotNetBookstore-S26.git
cd DotNetBookstore-S26
```

### Restore Dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore DotNetBookstore/DotNetBookstore.csproj
```

### Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run --project DotNetBookstore/DotNetBookstore.csproj
```

Or press **F5** in Visual Studio to launch with debugging. The default launch URLs are:

- `https://localhost:7296`
- `http://localhost:5170`

---

## Opening in VS Code

This repository includes a `.vscode/` configuration folder for a full VS Code development experience. These files are completely ignored by Visual Studio 2026 and do not affect that workflow in any way.

### VS Code Configuration Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.vscode/launch.json` | Two debug configs: **Launch (http)** on port 5170, **Launch (https)** on ports 7296/5170, plus Attach |
| `.vscode/tasks.json` | `build` (default Ctrl+Shift+B), `publish`, and `watch` tasks via `dotnet` CLI |
| `.vscode/settings.json` | Points to `DotNetBookstore.slnx`, format-on-save for C# and Razor, hides `bin/` and `obj/` from Explorer |
| `.vscode/extensions.json` | Workspace-recommended extensions (auto-prompted on first open) |

### Required Extensions

Accept the workspace prompt on first open, or install manually from the Extensions panel:

| Extension ID | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ms-dotnettools.csharp` | C# language support — IntelliSense, diagnostics, go-to-definition |
| `ms-dotnettools.csdevkit` | C# Dev Kit — Solution Explorer, test runner, enhanced refactoring |
| `ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-runtime` | .NET runtime installer used by the above extensions |

### Steps to Open and Run

1. **Open the folder** — `File → Open Folder` → select the `DotNetBookstore-S26/` root directory.
2. **Install extensions** — accept the prompt to install recommended extensions, then reload VS Code.
3. **Create `appsettings.json`** — this file is gitignored (keeps credentials out of source control). Create it at `DotNetBookstore/appsettings.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=DotNetBookstoreDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=True"
     },
     "Logging": {
       "LogLevel": {
         "Default": "Information",
         "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
       }
     },
     "AllowedHosts": "*"
   }
   ```

   > Alternatively, store the connection string in [User Secrets](#️-connection-string-security) instead of `appsettings.json`.

4. **Apply migrations** (first run only — skip if the database already exists from Visual Studio):

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update --project DotNetBookstore/DotNetBookstore.csproj
   ```

5. **Run / Debug** — press `F5`, select **Launch (http)** or **Launch (https)** from the dropdown, and VS Code will build, start the app, and open the browser automatically.

   For hot-reload development, use the `watch` task instead (`Terminal → Run Task → watch`):

   ```bash
   dotnet watch run --project DotNetBookstore/DotNetBookstore.csproj
   ```

### Trust the HTTPS Dev Certificate (once per machine)

```bash
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

---

## Database Setup

The application uses **EF Core code-first** with two migrations:

| Migration | Description |
|---|---|
| `00000000000000_CreateIdentitySchema` | ASP.NET Core Identity tables |
| `20260529000439_CreateBookstoreTables` | Categories, Books, CartItems, Orders, OrderDetails |

Apply all migrations to a new database:

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project DotNetBookstore/DotNetBookstore.csproj
```

If the EF CLI tool is not installed:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

Add a new migration after model changes:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add YourMigrationName --project DotNetBookstore/DotNetBookstore.csproj
dotnet ef database update --project DotNetBookstore/DotNetBookstore.csproj
```

See [`Docs/Post-Model-Change-Migrations-Guide.md`](DotNetBookstore/Docs/Post-Model-Change-Migrations-Guide.md) for detailed guidance.

---

## Configuration

### ⚠️ Connection String Security

**Never commit real credentials to source control.** Use [User Secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets) for local development:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection" "your-connection-string" --project DotNetBookstore/DotNetBookstore.csproj
```

### Connection String Examples

**Local SQL Server (Windows Auth):**
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=dotnetbookstore;Trusted_Connection=True"
  }
}
```

**Azure SQL Database:**
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=your-server.database.windows.net;Database=dotnetbookstore-azure;User Id=dba;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;TrustServerCertificate=true"
  }
}
```

---

## Documentation

The `Docs/` folder contains detailed developer guides:

| Document | Description |
|---|---|
| [`Post-Scaffolding-Guide-OneToMany.md`](DotNetBookstore/Docs/Post-Scaffolding-Guide-OneToMany.md) | Step-by-step fixes for scaffolded CRUD after adding one-to-many relationships — FK dropdowns, eager loading, Bind list trimming, dropdown repopulation |
| [`Post-Model-Change-Migrations-Guide.md`](DotNetBookstore/Docs/Post-Model-Change-Migrations-Guide.md) | Guide for safely adding EF Core migrations after model changes |

---

## UI Enhancement History

| Phase | Changes |
|---|---|
| Initial scaffold | Basic scaffolded CRUD views with default Bootstrap styling |
| Post-scaffolding fixes | Fixed FK dropdowns (`CategoryId` → `<select>`), added `.Include()` eager loading, replaced raw FK integers with human-readable category names, removed reverse navigation collection columns |
| Bootstrap 5 UI pass | Full overhaul of all 14 views: dark navbar with Bootstrap Icons 1.11.3 (CDN), hero home page with feature cards, hover tables with image thumbnails and colour badges, card-wrapped forms with `input-group` icons, `form-switch` for boolean fields, danger confirmation cards, styled error page, sticky dark footer |
| **Modern Design System** | Complete redesign of all 15 views and `site.css`: indigo/purple brand gradient replacing plain dark; CSS custom property token system (`--brand-gradient`, `--card-shadow`, `--radius-card`, etc.); Books and Categories index pages converted from tables to responsive card grids; live cover image preview (JS) in Create/Edit forms; layered gradient placeholder + real image on all cover slots with silent `onerror` fallback; two-column Details view (cover + metadata); active nav link via server-side controller detection; TempData toast area in layout; empty states with icon + CTA; page-header component with left accent border; `divider-gradient` separator; lift-on-hover transitions on all interactive cards and buttons |
| **File Upload** | Cover image upload via `multipart/form-data` `<input type="file">` replacing the previous URL text field. Files saved to `wwwroot/img/books/` with GUID-prefixed names to prevent collisions. `IWebHostEnvironment` injected into `BooksController` for `WebRootPath` resolution. `UploadImage()` helper writes the file; `DeleteImage()` helper removes orphaned files on cover replace or book delete. Edit form shows the existing thumbnail and preserves it when no new file is chosen. FileReader API drives the in-browser live preview on Create and Edit without a round-trip. `app.UseStaticFiles()` added to `Program.cs` so uploaded runtime files are served from `wwwroot/`. |
